## Status Quo
The app is structured using a Bottom NavigationBar.
The Main Page contains a ListView including every timeslot and every event. Users can expand events to get further information.
The Second Page contains an impressum.
Using the prominent FloatingActionBottom at the lower center of the app, users get to the registration page, where they are able to sign up for the congress.


## Planned features

1. **DONE** Presentation of the events 
2. **DONE** Registration for the it-congress.
3. **DONE** Detail views have been implemented using a conditional rendering that renders an expandable widget if a description is available
4. Implementation of a notify-function: Users can subscribe to events they're interested in, and get notified when they are about to start.
5. Implementation of a rating and communication system for the user to rate the event and provide further feedback through a text-input.

## Current ToDos

Check if outsourcing of the .json file onto HNU's servers is possible. Feature #4
