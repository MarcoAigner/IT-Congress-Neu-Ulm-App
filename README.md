## Status Quo
The app is structured using a Bottom NavigationBar.
The Main Page contains a ListView containing every timeslot and its corresponding events.
The Second Page contains a simple impressum.
Using the prominent FloatingActionBottom at the lower center of the app, users get to the registration page, where they are able to sign up for the congress.


## Planned features

1. **DONE** Presentation of the events 
2. **DONE** Registration for the it-congress.
3. Detail-views of each event including the title, lecturer, and optional images or descriptions
4. Implementation of a notify-function: Users can subscribe to events they're interested in, and get notified when they are about to start.
5. Implementation of a rating and communication system for the user to rate the event and provide further feedback through a text-input.

## Current ToDos

Refine the layout. Check if outsourcing of the .json file onto HNU's servers is possible. Feature #3
