# IT Congress app

This project is implementing an app, representing the annual "it-congress" held at hnu university of applied sciences in Neu-Ulm.

## Status Quo
By now, the app is structured using a bottom navigation bar.
The main page will inform about every event at the congress.
A prominent floating action button at the bottom of the app will lead to a registration page.
A second page will inform the user about the app itself and its creators
The app will be designed to retrieve its information through an incoming .json-file. This file will be held locally for debugging reasons. Later on, this method can be extended to try to retrieve the latest version of the file from a backend.
This way, easy editing is assured.

## Planned features

1. **DONE** Presentation of the events 
2. **DONE** Registration for the it-congress.
3. Detail-views of each event including the title, lecturer, and optional images or descriptions
4. Implementation of a notify-function: Users can subscribe to events they're interested in, and get notified when they are about to start.
5. Implementation of a rating and communication system for the user to rate the event and provide further feedback through a text-input.

## Current ToDos

Refine the layout. Check if outsourcing of the .json file onto HNU's servers is possible. Feature #3
