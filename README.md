# IT Congress app

This project is implementing an app, representing the annual "it-congress" held at hnu university of applied sciences in Neu-Ulm.

## Status Quo
By now, the app is structured using a bottom navigation bar.
The main page will inform about every event at the congress.
A prominent floating action button at the bottom of the app will lead to a registration page.
A second page will inform the user about the app itself and its creators
The app will be designed to retrieve its information through an incoming .json-file. This file will be held locally for debugging reasons. Later on, this method can be extended to try to retrieve the latest version of the file from a backend.
This way, easy editing is assured.

## Planned features

1. Presentation of the events (it is still unsure which design method will be used in order to be most comforting to the user).
2. Registration for the it-congress.
3. Detail-views of each event including the title, lecturer, and optional images or descriptions
4. Implementation of a notify-function: Users can subscribe to events they're interested in, and get notified when they are about to start.
5. Implementation of a rating and communication system for the user to rate the event and provide further feedback through a text-input.

## Current ToDos

Choice of a layout option in which to present the events and implementation of it.
